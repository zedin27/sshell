# sshell

Experiments with creating a simple shell using C

`sshell` is a shell similar to bash and zsh which can do the following:
1. execute user-supplied commands with optional arguments
2. offer a selection of builtin commands
3. redirect the standard input or standard output of commands to files
4. pipe the output of commands to other commands
5. put commands in the background
